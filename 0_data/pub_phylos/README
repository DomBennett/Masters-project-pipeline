The best phylogenetic trees I could find that covered the same taxonomic
groups.
I originally did searches for papers, and searched through their supmats.
On failing that I searched treebase and took the trees with the most
taxa.

Danforth_all.txt -- contains all the trees from the paper. I used the
first one on this list.
